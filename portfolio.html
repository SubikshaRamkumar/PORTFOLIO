          <p><b>A.R. Rahman</b>, in full Allah Rakha Rahman, original name <b><u>A.S. Dileep Kumar</u></b>, (born January 6, 1966, Madras [now Chennai], India), 
            Indian composer whose extensive body of work for film and stage earned him the nickname “the Mozart of Madras.”

            Rahman’s father, <b>R.K. Sekhar</b>, was a prominent Tamil musician who composed scores for the Malayalam film industry, 
            and Rahman began studying piano at age four. The boy’s interests lay in electronics and computers, and his father’s
             serendipitous purchase of a synthesizer allowed him to pursue his passion and to learn to love music at the same time.
              Sekhar died when Rahman was 9 years old, and by age 11 he was playing <u>piano</u> professionally to help support his family. 
              He dropped out of school, but his professional experience led to a scholarship to study at Trinity College, Oxford,
             where he received a degree in Western classical music.<br><br>
             Rahman initially composed scores for different documentaries and jingles for advertisements and Indian television channels. 
             With his in-house studio Panchathan Record Inn, Rahman's film-scoring career began during the early 1990s with the Tamil film 
             Roja.Following that, he went on to score several songs for Tamil language films, including Ratnam's politically charged Bombay,
              the urban Kadhalan, Thiruda Thiruda, and S. Shankar's debut film Gentleman. Rahman's score for his first Hollywood film, the 
              comedy Couples Retreat (2009), won the BMI Award for Best Score. His music for Slumdog Millionaire (2008) earned him Best Original 
              Score and Best Original Song at the 81st Academy Awards. He was also awarded Best Compilation Soundtrack Album and Best Song 
              Written for Visual Media at the 2010 Grammy Awards. He is nicknamed "Isai Puyal" (musical storm) and "Mozart of Madras".
<br><br>
             Rahman has also become a humanitarian and philanthropist, donating and raising money for a number of causes and charities. In 
             2006, he was honoured by Stanford University for his contributions to global music.In 2008, he received Lifetime Achievement
              Award from the Rotary Club of Madras. In 2009, he was included on the Time list of the world's 100 most influential people.
               In 2013, he introduced 7.1 surround sound technology to South Indian films. In 2014, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from 
               Berklee College of Music. He has also received honorary doctorate from Aligarh Muslim University.In 2017, he made his debut 
               as a director and writer for the film Le Musk.</p></fieldset>

             <p>In 1992, he was approached by director Mani Ratnam to compose the score and soundtrack for his Tamil film,<b> Roja</b>.

              Rahman's film career began in 1992 when he started Panchathan Record Inn, a recording and mixing studio in his backyard. 
              It would become the most-advanced recording studio in India, and arguably one of Asia's most sophisticated and high-tech studios.
              Cinematographer Santosh Sivan signed Rahman for his second film Yoddha, a Malayalam film starring Mohanlal and directed by Sivan's 
              brother Sangeeth Sivan that released in September 1992.
              
              The following year, Rahman received the <b>National Film Awards (Silver Lotus)</b> award for best music director at the National Film Awards for Roja.
               The films' score was critically and commercially successful in its original and dubbed versions, led by the innovative theme 
               <u>"Chinna Chinna Aasai"</u>. Rahman followed this with successful scores and songs for Tamil–language films for the Chennai film industry, 
               including Ratnam's politically charged Bombay, Thiruda Thiruda and S. Shankar's debut film Gentleman (with its popular dance song, 
               "Chikku Bukku Rayile"), the urban Kadhalan.Rahman collaborated with director Bharathiraaja on Kizhakku Cheemayile and 
               Karuththamma, producing successful Tamil rural folk-inspired film songs; he also composed for K. Balachander's Duet, which had some 
               memorable Saxophone themes.The 1995 film Indira and romantic comedies Mr. Romeo and Love Birds also drew attention
              
              <br><br>
            
              Rahman attracted a Japanese audience with Muthu's success there. His soundtracks are known in the Tamil Nadu film 
              industry and abroad for his versatility in combining Western classical music, Carnatic and Tamil traditional and folk-music 
              traditions, jazz, reggae and rock music.The soundtrack for Bombay sold 15 million copies worldwide, and
               "Bombay Theme" would later reappear in his soundtrack for Deepa Mehta's Fire and a number of compilations and other media.
                It was featured in the 2002 Palestinian film Divine Intervention and the 2005 Nicolas Cage film, Lord of War. Rangeela, 
                directed by Ram Gopal Varma, was Rahman's Bollywood debut. Successful scores and songs for Dil Se.. and the percussive 
                Taal followed.Sufi mysticism inspired "Chaiyya Chaiyya" from the former film and "Zikr" from his soundtrack album
                 for Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero (which featured elaborate orchestral and choral arrangements).
<br><br>
              Rahman's soundtrack album for the Chennai production Minsaara Kanavu won him his second National Film Award for Best Music 
              Direction and a South FilmFare Award for Best Music Direction in a Tamil film in 1997, the latter setting a record of six
               consecutive wins; he later went on to win the award three consecutive additional times. The musical cues in the soundtrack
                albums for Sangamam and Iruvar used Carnatic vocals, the veena, rock guitar and jazz. During the 2000s, Rahman composed 
                scores and popular songs for Rajiv Menon's Kandukondain Kandukondain, Alaipayuthey, Ashutosh Gowariker's Swades, Rang De
                 Basanti and songs with Hindustani motifs for 2005's Water. Rahman has worked with Indian poets and lyricists such as 
                 Javed Akhtar, Gulzar, Vairamuthu and Vaali, and has produced commercially successful soundtracks with directors Mani Ratnam 
                 and S. Shankar (Gentleman, Kadhalan, Indian, Jeans, Mudhalvan, Nayak, Boys, Sivaji, Enthiran, I and 2.0).

              most cutting-edge studio in Asia. The following year he launched his own music label, KM Music, with his score
               for Sillunu Oru Kaadhal. Rahman scored the Mandarin-language film Warriors of Heaven and Earth in 2003 after researching
                and using Chinese and Japanese classical music, and won the Just Plain Folks Music Organization|Just Plain Folks Music

                  Skilled in Carnatic music, Western and Hindustani classical music and the Qawwali style of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan,
                   Rahman is noted for film songs amalgamating elements of these and other genres, layering instruments from different
                    musical idioms in an improvisational style. During the 1980s Rahman recorded monaural arrangements in common
                     with his musical predecessors, K. V. Mahadevan and Vishwanathan–Ramamoorthy. He has also worked as a pianist in Ilaiyaraaja's
                      troupe for hundreds of movies. In later years his methodology changed, as he experimented with the fusion of
                       traditional instruments with new electronic sounds and technology.<br><br>

Rahman's musical interests and outlook originate in his love of experimentation. His compositions have an auteuristic use of counterpoint, 
orchestration and the human voice, melding Indian pop music with a unique timbre, form and instrumentation. With this syncretic style and 
wide-ranging lyrics, the appeal of Rahman's music crosses classes and cultures in Indian society.<br><br>

His first soundtrack, for Roja, was listed on Time's all-time "10 Best Soundtracks" in 2005. Film critic Richard Corliss said that the 
composer's "astonishing debut work parades Rahman's gift for alchemizing outside influences until they are totally Tamil, totally Rahman",
 and his initial global success is attributed to the South Asian diaspora. Music producer Ron Fair considers Rahman "one of the world's
 great living composers in any medium".

<B>Director Baz Luhrmann said:</B>
I had come to the music of A. R. Rahman through the emotional and haunting score of Bombay and the wit and celebration of Lagaan.
 But the more of AR's music I encountered the more I was to be amazed at the sheer diversity of styles: from swinging brass bands to 
 triumphant anthems; from joyous pop to West-End musicals. Whatever the style, A. R. Rahman's music always possesses a profound sense
  of humanity and spirit, qualities that inspire me the most.<bR><br>

Rahman introduced 7.1 surround sound technology to South Indian films. Rahman is one of the best-selling music artists in India 
with an estimated 150 million records sold worldwide. On 21 May 2014 Rahman announced that he has partnered with former
 Black Eyed Peas' Will.i.am to recreate an early popular track 'Urvashi Urvashi'. Track is 'Birthday'.
